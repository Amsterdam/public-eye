Public Eye can be used to accurately perform crowd counting tasks using video camera streams. Public Eye has many built-in features, such as:

- **Camera management**
- **Video capturing**
- **Image collection management**
- **Image tagging**
- **Dataset management**
- **Crowd-counting model training**
- **Line-of-interest model training**
- **Live model deployment (highly scalable)**

Public Eye is currently in the Alpha phase of development.
